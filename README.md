ðŸ“– Librerio â€“ Library Management System in Java

Librerio is a Java-based console application that will simulate the operations of a library. The project is built step by step to practice core and advanced Java concepts.

âœ¨ Planned Features

Book Management â†’ the system will allow adding, removing, searching, and listing books.

User Management â†’ it will support different user roles such as students and librarians.

Borrow & Return System â†’ students will be able to borrow and return books, while librarians will manage the catalog.

Data Persistence â†’ all books and users will be saved to files (serialization) and reloaded when the program restarts.

Search & Filtering â†’ the system will provide searching by title, author, or category and filtering with enums and streams.

Thread Safety â†’ multiple users will be able to borrow/return books concurrently using multithreading and synchronization.

Logging â†’ every action (borrow, return, add, remove) will be logged into a file.

Background Tasks â†’ a background thread will automatically save library data at regular intervals.

Console Interface â†’ a menu-driven interface will guide users through all library operations.

ðŸŽ¯ Learning Goals

Librerio is designed as a practice project to apply:

Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, polymorphism).

Java Collections (ArrayList, HashMap, generics, comparators).

Exception handling and custom exceptions.

Multithreading and synchronization.

File I/O and serialization.

String handling and formatting.

Advanced Java (enums, interfaces, annotations, and modules).
